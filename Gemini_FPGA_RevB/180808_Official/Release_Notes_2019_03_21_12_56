# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This is the project config spec template file. It is used to specify the
# source, label, and branch requirements for a project. The template is
# made up of three fields, element, label, and integration branch.
# The file is read from top to bottom and this is the order in which each of
# the elements is output to the config spec file. Each item should be
# separated by a comma.
#
# The integration branch is the location where GVP is to merge the passing
# gather groups during a validate. DO NOT fill in the integration branch for
# other projects that you are just pointing to.
#
# The special string V_GVP_LABEL is expanded with the project label.
#
# Be sure to fill in the following gvp project variable to your project
# value. This helps gvp determine what the project is.
