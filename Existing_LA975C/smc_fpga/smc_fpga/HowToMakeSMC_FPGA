How to make SMC FPGA

1) from the idl directory, run the idl compiler with the following switches:

-file smc_fpga.idl -verilog -vba -verification -proj saratoga

Leave the created files in the idl directory.

2) from the syn directory, run synplify. It should ue the smc_fpga.prj file
as input. The path to the saratoga.vh file may need to be modified for
the actual path on the users system. In tsc, the file can be found in:

lib/tech_indep/verilog/include

The smc_fpga.sdc file should be used as the constraints file. This sets
the pinout for the part.

3) copy the smc_fpga.qdf output file (presently would be in the 
syn/pasic3 directory) to a PAR directory. Run the quicklogic tools.

Use File | Import | QDF to import the smc_fpga.qdf file. Run the tools.

The output smc_fpga.chp file is used to program parts.

Notes on simulation:

The sim directory contains a testbench that can be used to test out the
design. The verilog project will need to use files from the rtl and idl
directories. It will also need a paht to include the saratoga.vh
mentioned above.
